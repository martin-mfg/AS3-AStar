Micro-optimized version of [a fast Actionscript3 AStar implementation](https://github.com/tomnewton/AS3AStar) written by [Tom Newton](http://yyztom.com/).

A demo of the original version can be found on [his webpage](http://yyztom.com/post/4134224616/pretty-fast-astar-in-actionscript-3).

This repository is a fork of [shdpls work](https://github.com/shdpl/AS3-AStar) and fixes some bugs in the upstream repository. Please note that this forked version is probably a little bit slower than shdpls version but in return the calculated path is always as short as possible.
